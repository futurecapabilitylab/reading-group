🧾 FOWI Academy: Methods & Causal Inference Reading Group

 

Each week, the reading will be uploaded to Teams and the Outlook event.
Readings/materials predominantly focus on advancements in methods (including statistics) and causal inference.
If you have a paper suggestion, please email to me and I’ll put it in the queue 😊
Read the paper (or related content) prior to attending (though feel free to still come if you haven’t).

 

👁‍🗨 Inclusion

It is important all voices have an opportunity to be heard — everyone's input is valuable to understanding the material. We encourage active participation from all attendees and strive to foster an inclusive and collaborative group. All questions and comments are valid, this group embodies the universality of imposter syndrome.

 

📚🤝Teams + Log:

We have a shared file to “dump” papers, materials and things of that nature in:  Discussion Sessions and Materials.docx

 

🧭 Format + Structure

A session chair (rotating role) selects a paper for the group to read in advance. The chair starts sessions with a summary and prepares a few questions to stimulate early discussions. Otherwise, it’s open table discussion with no formal structure. For highly technical or niche topics, we try to provide a more accessible, but related, secondary paper.

 

💭 Feedback

Feel free to contact me at any point if you have feedback or requests for the sessions.
