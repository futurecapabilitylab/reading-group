<p>👁‍🗨 Inclusion</p>
<p>It is important all voices have an opportunity to be heard — everyone&rsquo;s input is valuable to understanding the material. We encourage active participation from all attendees and strive to foster an inclusive and collaborative group. All questions and comments are valid, this group embodies the universality of imposter syndrome.</p>
<p>📚🤝Teams + Log:</p>
<p>We have a shared file to “dump” papers, materials and things of that nature in:  Discussion Sessions and Materials.docx</p>
<p>🧭 Format + Structure</p>
<p>A session chair (rotating role) selects a paper for the group to read in advance. The chair starts sessions with a summary and prepares a few questions to stimulate early discussions. Otherwise, it’s open table discussion with no formal structure. For highly technical or niche topics, we try to provide a more accessible, but related, secondary paper.</p>
<p>💭 Feedback</p>
<p>Feel free to contact me at any point if you have feedback or requests for the sessions.</p>
